# robotron-2000

Welcome to Robotron 2000!

My goal with this project is to pratice and learn some Javascript skills.

It is still beeing improved. For now, you can interact with it adding or removing some robot components. As you do that,
the statistics of your robot will change. Try different sets!

To do so:

Click on "+" to add a component;
Click on "-" to remove a component.

Hope you like it! Don't forget to check my interactive on-line resume (https://raphael-barreiro.vercel.app).
Feel free to contact me anytime.
